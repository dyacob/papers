	Recently, when consulting on an editor for Ethiopic 
script, to be used<B> </B>from the standard Latin keyboards, it 
became of utility to write down<B> </B>and prioritize the 
features and principles we wished to implement. The document 
here was originally produced to aid GNU workers in their<B> 
</B>implementation of Ethiopic into the Multilingual version of 
Emacs. It is<B> </B>represented here as an itemized list of the 
features and concepts we thought valuable with only brief 
description of the numbered items.<B> </B>A discussion and 
defense of the list items would be the subject of<B> 
</B>another paper.  Elements of the document are strongly 
biased towards<B> </B>SERA which was the Latin I/O system 
we were working with for IM at the<B> </B>time.<P>
<B>Notes:</B><P>
<I>The ASCII representation of Ethiopic characters in this 
document adhere to the SERA standards as defined in the 
papers of Yaqob and Firdyiwek. SERA specific characters 
within quotes mean the actual Latin string whereas those 
within parentheses are the actual Ethiopic characters 
corresponding to the Latin string.</I><P>
<I>Items marked with * may be considered advanced 
features and as such</I> <I>are nonessential.</I><P>
<B>Input Method</B><P>
<B>1)  Key Mapping</B><P>
	Key mappings of Ethiopic characters onto Latin or other 
keyboards be done in a logical and consistent<B> </B>manner in 
agreement with the<B> </B>common sounds that the user will 
have learned for both character<B> </B>sets.<P>
<B>2)  Syllabic Entry</B><P>
	A minimal number of keystrokes be required to enter any 
character.<B> </B>The Latin characters "e","u","i","a","E","o" 
and "W" are<B> </B>recommended for changing the syllabic 
form of some base consonant.<P>
<B>3)  Dynamical Character Composition</B><P>
	The character being entered is updated at each phase 
of<B> </B>entry (at each new keystroke).<P>
Example:<P>
	"h" is struck<B> </B>and (h) appears, "2" or "W" is 
struck and (h2) or (hWa)<B> </B>appears, "E" is struck and 
finally (h2E) or (hWE) appears.<B> </B>Dynamic updating also 
applies for numbers.<P>
<B>4)  Default Word Separator is Latin-Blank</B><P>
	The blank space, " ", is the default word separator for 
entry.<B> </B>The Ethiopic separator, ":", may be chosen with 
an arbitrary<B> </B>toggle key.<P>
<B>5)  Default Punctuation is Ethiopic</B><P>
	Statistically, Ethiopic punctuation is in greater use 
than<B> </B>English punctuation in modern writing.  A toggle 
key is used<B> </B>to enter English punctuation.<P>
<B>6)  Default Numeral System is Arabic</B><P>
	Statistically, Arabic (0-9) numbers are in more regular 
use<B> </B>than Ethiopic.  A toggle key is used to enter the 
Ethiopic<B> </B>numerals.<P>
<B>7)  Quotation Entry</B><P>
	Ethiopic quotation marks be associated by glyph similarity 
to the math symbols &lt  and &gt  .  The quotes may be entered 
with either single or double keystrokes.  The math symbols should 
remain available with either single or double strike, in compliment 
with the quotation entry.<P>
<B>8)  Availability of Native Punctuation</B><P>
	All punctuation provided on the keyboard of entry should 
be<B> </B>available while in an Ethiopic input mode. This may 
usually<B> </B>be accomplished by a double strike method 
whereby the mapped<B> </B>Ethiopic punctuation is exchanged 
for the native at the 2nd<B> </B>strike.  Example : ";" is keyed 
and (;) appears, and when ";" is<B> </B>struck a 2nd time ";" 
replaces (;) and the entry terminates.<P>
<B>9)* Syllabic Form Editing (Diacritical Mark Edit 
Only)</B><P>
	A character entered previously may have its syllabic 
form<B> </B>updated with a single keystroke of the vowel for 
the desired<B> </B>new syllabic state.  Example : (ce) has 
been entered previously,<B> </B>the character (ce) is selected 
[by highlighting or by "operate<B> </B>left" principle] and the 
key "o" is struck, the (ce) glyph<B> </B>becomes (co), (co) 
remains chosen for additional changes.<P>
<B>10)* Syllabic Form Backspace (UnEnter Diacritical 
Mark)</B><P>
	A character just entered remains at the top of the edit 
queue<B> </B>until some new character is keyed.  A 
"backspace" or "delete"<B> </B>key would have the effect of 
undoing the last vowel entry and<B> </B>returns the glyph to its 
previous form.  Item (6) and (7) may<B> </B>be combined.  
Example : (he) has just been keyed in, "backspace" is hit and (he) 
-&gt  (h).  An "a" is now keyed and (h) -&gt  (ha),<B> </B>the 
edit is complete.<P>
<B>11)* Selective Word Separator On/Off 
Toggle</B><P>
	The need may arise for the user to exchange the Latin 
word<B> </B>separator, " ", with the Ethiopic, ":" or the Ethiopic 
for<B> </B>Latin.  A toggle key or menu option may provide 
this to a<B> </B>section of selected ("highlighted") text, where 
all word<B> </B>separators are exchanged within the bounds of 
the selection.<P>
<B>12)* Julian Date Stamp</B><P>
 	A menu item that offers conversion between the Ethio-
Julian and Gregorian calendar systems will be an asset of high 
value<B> </B>to the user.<P>
<B>13)* Old Style Typewriter Entry</B><P>
	Support for the Italian devised system for keyed entry 
is<B> </B>desirable as the input method remains in popular 
use.<P>
<B>File I/O</B><P>
<B>1) Software Native I/O</B><P>
	Considered arbitrary.<P>
<B>2) Latin Transliteration.</B><P>
	Transliteration into a common 7-bit system of mixed 
Ethiopic<B> </B>and a foreign script is desirable for simple 
import/exportation<B> </B>between the software of different 
vendors.  Transliteration is also required for encoded file transfer 
on 7-bit data networks.<P>
	<B>a) </B>The system of transliteration be along logical 
and phonetic<B> </B>guidelines such that the transliterated 
document may be read<B> </B>readily in encoded form.<P>
	<B>b)</B> The transliteration system permits output for 
the phonetical<B> </B>logics of  other Ethiopian languages like 
Tigrigna, Amharic<B> </B>etc. without causing conflict for 
input.<P>
