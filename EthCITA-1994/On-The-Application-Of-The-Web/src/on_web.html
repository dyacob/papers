<H2>Introduction</H2>

The path to Information Super Highway is in a continuos refinement.
The goal to attain massive data at a reasonable speed is being realized.
<p>
As the cost of hardware/software dwindles and the need for obtaining
information at ones finger-tips increases, we will see more and more
innovative means of sharing knowledge.
<p>
The future growth of a nation will ultimately depend on its ability
to effectively compete and know about its surroundings. No one can help
but join these waves of information in order to stay afloat.
<p>
<B>TO KNOW IS TO BE INFORMED</B> <i>and vice versa</i>.

<H2>
  <A HREF="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">World Wide Web</A>
</H2>

It has been recently estimated that over 11 terabytes of information
is available on the Internet. The amount of data is increasing as you
are reading this article. So is the thirst for knowledge in various
disciplines.<p>

The world wide web is a hypermedia system orginated by CERN, a high-energy
physics laboratory in Switzerland. Even though the physicists used it to
share papers among their peers, the web gained popularity among other
users.<p>

The flexibility of the web includes such diverse information as Gaelic texts,
art exhibits, movie clips, and electronic magazines.
<p>
Reading a book is a sequential activity but hypertext (hypermedia) is non-linear chain.<p>

One of the popular network information browsers that allows you to retrieve
documents from the world wide web is NCSA Mosaic. This WWW client is
available for Macintosh, Microsoft Windows on IBM PC-compatible and the X Window
System on UNIX computers.<p>

The National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), located at the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is one of the leading center
for the application of WWW browsers.<p>


<H2>Information Distribution</H2>

The 
  <A HREF="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">World Wide Web</A>
provides another kind of medium that serves the
distribution of information.  Different from E-mail list servers, the
user is required to make the journey to the subject material.  The Web
does not facilitate multi-user communication well in the immediate sense
that one would be accustomed to from IRC and E-mail exchanges
(most Web browsers will have a Usenet and E-mail interface however).
Indeed, this was never the intent of the Web, however some variety of current
news is available on the Web.  A good example is
  <A HREF="http://www.met.fu-berlin.de/DataSources/MetIndex.html">weather</A>
(most impressive when
  <A HREF="http://rs560.cl.msu.edu/weather/">interactive</A>
) and  
  <A HREF="http://www.atm.ch.cam.ac.uk/sports/Webs.html">sports</A>.<p>

The World Wide Web better serves archival type information.  That is, the
type of info you will like to have at hand as a reference.  Most Web Homepages
are in themselves a data base of interests of the writer.  It is left to
the original composer to keep the contents and links current. Many
<A HREF="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/DataSources/WWW/Servers.html">
universities and companies</A> now provide extensive Homepages giving full
details on the schools, departments, faculty, courses offered or products
offered.  You may even apply to a program at a Homepage as well as search for
the current address of a friend and look in on research projects.  A very
well developed and extensive data base is the
  <A HREF="http://www.african.upenn.edu/African_Studies/AS.html">African
Studies</A> Homepage at the

<H2>HTML Browsers as an FTP and Gopher Archive Interface</H2>

A secondary service that the Web provides is as graphical interface
for downloading and previewing files remotely stored files.  The ease of
use with mouse "point and shoot" makes navigating the Internet as familiar
to a user as clicking open folders in a 
  <A HREF="http://www.apple.com/">Macintosh</A> 
or
  <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/default.htm">Microsoft</A> 
Windows environment.  The 
  <A HREF="ftp://ftp.rpi.edu/pub/languages/ethiopia">Ethiopia</A>
ftp archives at 
  <A HREF="http://www.rpi.edu/">Rensselaer</A> Polytechnic Institute,
and the
  <A HREF="gopher://empire.nysernet.org:2347/7?Ethiopia">Empire</A> 
gopher archives are two informative sites to demonstrate this
ease of navigability.  The user need not remember the names, addresses
and passwords for the different archives at a given Homepage. Indeed
a Web surfer need not even know how to use ftp and gopher to access
the archives, or even the filename and address of the Homepage that
brought him or her there.  Nearly all Web browsing software allows one
to add your favorite sites to a "hotlist" to revisit later at the click
of a mouse button at some later time.

<H2>W3 for Personal Graphic Communication </H2>

The primary utility of the W3 is the incorporation of site, sound and text 
from across vast distances into a single form of presentation and
communication.  Though generally applied to communicate visual and text
data to a large audience, the Web does permit the same form of
communication privately between individuals.  An author experimented with
this to communicate graphical ideas in a hypertext
  <A HREF="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/hyplan/dmulholl/hypermail/yTna.html">letter</A>
to
  <A HREF="http://curry.edschool.Virginia.EDU:80/~ybf2u">
    <I>Yitna Firdyiwek</I></A>
who found the visual communication "...very helpful showing me what you were 
talking about." and added  "In our bilingual context, especially, ... the
graphic capabilities are enormous."  The implementation here that kept the
document private was to send by standard e-mail the name of the hypertext
document <I>only</I> to the person(s) the composer wished to read it.  The
same principle may be applied to assist the progression of 
  <A HREF="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/hyplan/dmulholl/hypermail/hypermail.html">
     group discussions </A>

when visual communication becomes advantageous for the advancement of the
topic.  Passwording files is also possible through HTML when security is
a concern.


<H2>The Expansion of 
   <A HREF="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/hyplan/dmulholl/gifs/fidel.gif">
   Ethiopic Script</A> 
   on the Web</H2>

The Ethiopic script that decorates the 
  <A HREF="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/hyplan/dmulholl/acg.html">Abyssinia
  CyberSpace Gateway</A> 
has been implemented by making gif files from 
  <A HREF="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/hyplan/dmulholl/info/software.html">Eview</A>
and 
  <A HREF="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/hyplan/dmulholl/mule.html">Mule</A>
documents.
This is a highly inefficient solution to providing Ge'ez text on the Web;
the data transmissions size requirements are orders of magnitude greater than
what would be needed for raw text.<p>

At present, web browsers have the text limitation of presenting at most
256 characters, and generally not more than 128.  The 
   <A HREF="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/hyplan/dmulholl/gifs/fidel_x.gif">extended</A>
Ethiopic Fidel has up to 357 characters.  Like many other writing systems
an encoding method is required to go between the 8-bit limitation and the
more copious 2nd script.  A 
   <A HREF="http://www.ntt.jp/Mosaic-l10n/README.html">multilingual</A>
version of Mosaic is capable of decoding 8-bit text into a "local" script
and present the decoded text with the appropriate font.  With 
  <A HREF="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/hyplan/dmulholl/fidel/sera.html">SERA</A>
(The System for Ethiopic Representation in ASCII) and with the X-Windows fonts
and font utilities at the Rensselaer archive, full Ethiopic implementation is
ready for Mosaic today.<p>
However, before making this great plunge into the hyper dimension of the W3,
it is a better approach for the long term that would be implementers put their
energies now into first bringing Fidel completely into Unicode.  At that
time, when addressing issues are resolved, the beauty of Fidel is sure to make
its expansion self propogating.
