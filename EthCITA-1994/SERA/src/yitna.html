<I></B>Dedicated to the work and memory of Abraham Demoz 
(1935-1994)</I><P><I>
</I>	In the time since the original publication of our paper in "The 
Journal<B> </B>of Ethio Science &amp  Technology" Volume 3, 
Number 1 on the topic of representation of<B> </B>Fidel in 7-bit ASCII, 
the need became apparent to extend the system to<B> </B>encompass 
representation for Ethiopic numerals, punctuation, and<B> </B>mixed 
script notations.  In the same period more was learned about the<B> 
</B>treatment of certain characters outside of Amharic that <B> 
</B>allowed for<B> </B>simplification of the ASCII 
representation.<P>
	The following is a recapitulation of the original publication and 
an<B> </B>assessment of some of the more recent developments.  A 
complete<B> </B>discussion of many of these changes (and a revised 
copy of the original publication) are available at the Rensselar Polytechnic 
Institute ftp<B> </B>archive under the file names ETHIOPIC and 
ADDENDUM.<P>
	As we have indicated before, this system, though well developed, 
is<B> </B>still not in its final form.  Further refinements will only come 
after<B> </B>many have had the chance to use it and test its strengths 
and weaknesses<B> </B>on their own.  As Abraham Demoz, to whom 
we have dedicated this work,<B> </B>noted: <P>
<I>"...script reform calls not only for a competent 
professional assessment of the technical aspects of the script 
but also for a careful weighing of<B> </B>these against the 
psychological and socio-political factors that have a<B> 
</B>bearing on the written word and all that it stands for"

</B><B>1.  The System for Ethiopic Representation of ASCII 
(SERA) Table</B><P>
	Although some questions still remain to be answered regarding 
the number of "forms" to use for the ASCII/ETHIOPIC table, we have 
retained the original arrangement of twelve (12) for SERA pending 
decisions relating to the Unicode/ISO standards currently under 
discussion.  (See Abass' paper in this conference.)  We do not believe a 
change in the matrix of the table will affect the work discussed in this 
paper.<P>

(Letters will be referred to both by their ASCII spelling and by their 
position on the above number matrix (e.g. "he" or 1/1).  The columns 
arealso  known as "forms" (e.g., first form, second form, .etc.) or by their 
Ethiopic names: e.g. g`Iz, ka`Ib, sals, . . .etc.)<P>
<B>2.  Considerations We Took in the Development of 
SERA</B><P><B>
</B>We have taken the following two considerations in coming up with 
our<B> </B>proposed standard<P>
      a)   The system must be easy to type on a 101 keyboard.  This 
entails:<P>
	<B>--   </B>finding the closest match between the Latin and 
Ethiopic phonetic<B> </B>system (while being as systematic as possible 
with the inevitable exceptions),<P>
	--   limiting the number of keystrokes necessary for each Ethiopic 
character to a minimum, and<P>
	--   placing the most frequently used keys as close as possible to 
the "home keys" row of the 101 keyboard<P>
      b)   The system must also be easy for machine translation.  In<B> 
</B>this case, the systematicity of the mapping of Ethiopic to<B> 
</B>ASCII is exploited to make the machine translation between ASCII 
and Ethiopic script (in word processors, for example)<B> </B>as fast as 
possible.<P>
<B>3.  Development of the System</B><P><B>
</B>	It may first occur to one when attempting to write Ethiopic script 
with Latin letters, to represent the 7 forms with numbers as so:<P>
      Consonants:<P>
      h1   h2   h3   h4   h5   h6   h7<P>
      Independent Vowels:<P>
      a1   a2   a3   a4   a5   a6   a7<P>
	It is soon found in practice, however, that while this is a very 
simple<B> </B>system for representing the Ethiopic characters, it is not 
so simple to<B> </B>read or write in it (e.g., "T5n1y6s6T6l6N6", 
"a1d5s6 a1b1b4").  This is<B> </B>true largely because our minds are 
not trained to associate the Latin<B> </B>script with Arabic numbers to 
form words.  One will soon wonder why<B> </B>not use the Latin 
vowel letters to denote the 7 forms of the <B> </B>Ethiopic<B> 
</B>characters.  This is where the trouble begins:  How do you 
represent the<B> </B>standard 7 Ethiopic <B> </B>forms (plus the 
"W" forms) with only 5 Latin<B> </B>vowels?<P>
	The first step we took was to assign a punctuation mark (the<B> 
</B>apostrophe ') and "I" for the two extra Ethiopic vowels (plus "W" 
for<B> </B>forms 8-12).  So, following phonetic guide lines we came up 
with the<B> </B>following system:<P>
      <B>Consonants:</B><P>
      h'   hu   hi   ha   he   hI   ho<P>
      <B>Independent Vowels:</B><P>
      a'   au   ai   aa   ae   aI   ao<P>
	Again, after some trial use (e.g., "Ten'yIsITIlINI", "a'disI a'b'ba") 
we found that the writing can be made more readable if we used only one 
character for the pure vowel form.  Then the system reduces to:<P>
      <B>Consonants:</B><P>
      l'   lu   li   la   le   lI   lo<P>
      <B>Independent Vowels:</B><P>
       '    u    i    a    e    I    o<P>
	and our sample text would look like:  "TenayIsITIlINI", "'disI 
'b'ba" which becomes a little easier to read and to type.<P>
	After a short time a reader is likely to find that trying to "read 
a<B> </B>sound" from punctuation proves too difficult.  Our minds have 
been<B> </B>conditioned for too long already to skip over apostrophes 
when reading possesive and contracted words.  We introduce the 
principle now that<B> </B>whenever possible punctuation be avoided to 
represent spoken sounds<B> </B>and seek another alphabetic character 
to replace the apostrophe.<P>
	We find a suitable substitute in "E" but recognize right away the 
draw<B> </B>back of the extra "shift" required to type it.  With only a 
small<B> </B>intuitive feeling one will come to realize that the 5th form 
letters are used less often in writing than are 1st form.  Hence a swap 
between the<B> </B>two forms makes the use of "E" a little easier and 
gives us the new<B> </B>table:<P>
      <B>Consonants:</B><P>
      le   lu   li   la   lE   lI   lo<P>
      <B>Independent Vowels:</B><P>
       e    u    i    a    E    I    o<P>
and our sample text appears a little more naturally as: "TEnayIsITIlINI", 
"edisI ebeba"<P>
It is at this point that we began to notice two problems:<P>
      1)   the 6th (or "sadis") form of the Ethiopic characters occurs more 
often than any other form (about a third more often),and<P>
      2)   the use of "e" for the first vowel makes the "look" of some 
familiar Amharic words peculiar, and the sound association is poor.<P>
<B>The quick solution:</B><P>
      1)   stop using "I" for the sadis (sixth form) consonants, letting<B> 
</B>the consonants stand by themselves, and<B> </B> <P>
      2)  	allow the use of "a" for the first form independent vowel with<B> 
</B>"e", and introduce "A" for the 4th form independent vowel.<P>
     <B> Consonants:</B><P>
      le   lu   li   la   lE   l    lo<P>
     <B> Independent Vowels:</B><P>
       e\a  u    i    A    E    I    o<P>
      <B>Examples:</B><P>

            adis abeba<P>

<B>Ambiguity Problem with The Independent Vowel</B><P><B>
</B>	This system is easier to read and type, but there is still a problem. 
If you have never before seen the word "Tena" how will you know if you 
are reading 2 Ethiopic characters or 4 -- "TE-na" or "T-E-n-a"?  This 
problem of ambiguity usually occurs because it is not clear whether a 
consonant letter is a sadis (6th) form followed by an independent vowel 
form, or a syllable made up of the consonant and following vowel form. 
Of course, this is a problem only if the reader does not know the 
language.  An Amharic speaker would not make such a mistake.<P>
	In another scenario, the name "Gabriel" can be read "ge-b-r-E-l" 
(correctly), or "ge-b-rE-l" (not quite correct, but okay when speaking 
fast).  Though the ambiguity is there, whether you interpret the Latin as 
showing 5 (ge-b-r-E-l) characters or 4 (ge-b-rE-l) makes almost no 
difference.<P>
	These conditions may not always be true, however, and the 
difference does become a big  problem for word processors and 
computer software for translation.  It is better then to insure that the 
characters are unmistakably represented.  To accomplish this, our 
decision was to recycle the apostrophe ' as a separator for independent 
vowels that appear after a sadis (sixth form) consonant.  Thus, we can 
rewrite Gabriel as "gabrEl" and modify our system, which now includes a 
third category, accordingly:<P>
     <B> Consonants:</B><P>
      le   lu   li   la   lE   l    lo<P>
     <B> Independent Vowels:</B><P>
       e\a  u    i    A    E    I    o<P>
      <B>Independent Vowels Following a 6th Form 
Consonant:</B><P>
      l'a   l'u   l'i   l'A   l'E   l'I   l'o<P>
      l'e   lU                            lO     &lt --also<P>
	If we consider now an application for the remaining uppercase 
vowels;<B> </B>"U" and "O", we find that in some instances, as shown 
in the 2nd row<B> </B>of the third category, the use of the apostrophe 
may be omitted without<B> </B>confusion.<P>
<B>4.  Some Commonly Asked Questions</B><P><B>
</B><B>1.   Why not use "sh" for "x" and "ie" or "y" for 
"E"?</B><P><B>
</B>These would make logical choices for readers familiar with 
rules in English but may not make sence  in non-English<B> 
</B>speaking nations where a form of the Latin script is 
used.<B> </B>It is desirable also to keep the keystrokes to a 
minimum for<B> </B>humans, the parsing requirements of 
computers as simple as<B> </B>possible, and media and 
transfer sizes to a minimum by<B> </B>avoiding multiple 
character representations when possible.<P>
Further, the reader is left to infer the meaning "sh" as one<B> 
</B>or two Fidel characters.  The separator ' presents a 
solution<B> </B>here but again complicates parsing and 
introduces special<B> </B>case rules vs generalized ones.  The 
acception to the general<B> </B>rules also lends towards 
greater occurences of spelling errors. "ie" may be an easier 
keystroke than "E" but again<B> </B>introduces inference and 
parsing <B> </B>complexity.  The choice is<B> </B>not 
always logical as a phonetic model for the "ay" sound<B> 
</B>with Latin letters when considering such examples as 
"die",<B> </B>"vie", "pie", "lie", and "tie".<B> </B><P><B>
</B>"y" occurs more commonly in speech and written text as 
a<B> </B>consonant than as a syllabic form.  Hence the 
lowercase Latin<B> </B>character is better reserved for the 
consonant to save on<B> </B>keystrokes.<B> </B><P>
When an Ethiopic interface is available, these kinds of<B> 
</B>questions become input method issues and not file IO 
and<B> </B>transfer which SERA was primarily designed 
for.<P>
<B>2.   What if I wish to show more sound for a sadis 
consonant?</B><P>
*	It is not always accurate to say that the vowel component of  the 
sadis consonant is not spoken.  For many words the vowel<B> 
</B>in the 6th form consonant is clearly enounced.  If you wish 
to write in a more phonetic manner with out loss of clarity;<B> 
</B>this may be accomplished by writing the 2 character<B> 
</B>representation form of the sadis consonant when it is 
needed.<B> </B>As you will recall we have redefined the 2 
character form of<B> </B>the 6th consonant as "l|".  We can 
mix the two character and<B> </B>one character forms <B> 
</B>together in the same word to show when<B> </B>the 
vowel portion is voiced:<P>
                ysTlN  =  y|sT|l|N<P>
                tgrNa  =  tg|r|Na<P>
                alfelgm  =  alfel|g|m<P>
                TrE  =  T|rE<P>
Writing with both the one and two character representations<B> 
</B>of the 6th form consonant together may be more laborious 
to<B> </B>the typist but has the advantage of giving the reader 
a<B> </B>better demonstration of the word's sound when 
spoken. The<B> </B>mixed representation is not ambiguous and 
does not pose any<B> </B>problem for machine translation 
when going from Latin to<B> </B>Ethiopic.  If it would become 
a common practice to mix the<B> </B>two systems, we may 
wish to try alternate characters in place of the pipe ( "|" ).<P>
<B>3.      I see the ' used in other ways, what are the 
complete rules?</B><P><B>
</B>The apostrophe was introduced as a separator to indicated 
that a vowel after a 6th form consonant does not modify the<B> 
</B>form of the consonant, ie "nE" is one Fidel letter and 
"n'E"<B> </B>is two. The principle of the separator may be 
applied<B> </B>elsewhere when it enhances clarity.  For 
instance between<B> </B>vowels as in "beadis" vs "be'adis" or 
"keityoPya" vs<B> </B>"ke'ityoPya".  Here, the ' helps prevent 
the reader from<B> </B>slipping back into rules of English 
where the vowels would be<B> </B>combined into a single 
sound. Also ' following a consonant<B> </B>as in "t'" may be 
treated as another definition for the 6th<B> </B>form 
representation when convenient.<B> </B> <P>
<B>4.   Why Are Numbers Used With 
Letters?</B><P><B>
</B>A problem that occurs when trying to represent 
Ethiopic<B> </B>script phonetically in Latin is the presence<B> 
</B>of Ethiopic<B> </B>letters that are phonetic equivalents. 
These cases are<B> </B>encountered with the two Ethiopic 
characters for "s" and "S"<B> </B>and the 4 characters for "h".  
Representing one of the 2nd<B> </B>forms with an unused 
Latin character, say F, R, or V, would<B> </B>be a digression 
from phonetic norms and adds a level of<B> </B>complication 
to the reading. In the case of what would<B> </B>be h4 the 
uppercase "H" is chosen for <B> </B>representation.  This<B> 
</B>choice models the husky "kh" sound that the character has 
in<B> </B>Tigrinia and other languages.<P>
For the more common type of email exchanges omitting the 
number 2 or 3 does not result in a loss of interpretation.<B> 
</B>The use of the ordinals becomes more important later if 
the<B>  </B>text is to be read and translated into Ethiopic script 
by<B>  </B>computer.<B> </B> <P>
<B>5.   Why Does "s2" Come Before "s" ?</B><P><B>
</B>The "2" is only needed to distinguish the difference between 
the two "s"s in Ethiopic script. In modern writing it is<B> 
</B>the newer "s" (the 2nd "s" appearing in the fidel) that 
finds<B> </B>the most frequent use in the spelling of words. 
The first "s"<B> </B>is represented as "s2" because it occurs 
less frequently in<B> </B>writing. Were the 2nd "s" labeled as 
"s2" it would give the<B> </B>typist considerably more finger 
work to perform.<P>
<B>6.   How was "e3" arrived at for the 8th 
vowel?</B><P><B>
</B>The choice of "e3" is thought to be the best model for 
the<B> </B>sound of the character. The choice of a numeral to 
follow "e"<B> </B>will detract from the reading quality of the 
character, which<B> </B>should come at a small cost when its 
infrequent use is<B> </B>considered.<P>
<B>7.   Why is The Capital "W" Used For Diqala 
Forms?</B><P><B>
</B>The uppercase "W" is used to remain phonetically consistent 
with the sound of the diqala forms (forms 8 - 12). The lower case 
"w" is reserved exclusively for consonant 21 with the  "w" sound.  
<P>
Thus confusion and ambiguity is avoided with use of the 
uppercase "W".<P>
<B>8.   Why is "Wu" Used For the Letter I learned was 
"W"?</B><P><B>
</B>Actually both are valid under SERA.  In different 
geographic<B> </B>regions, and at different times within the 
same region, people have been taught two different sounds for 
the 2nd form labiovelar (which one may have learned as a 6th 
form).<B> </B>Phonetic representation as "kWu" "kW" and 
"kW'", in example, is permitted for both ways a person may have 
been taught.<P>
<B>9.   Why is "hWa" used in place of "`hWa" or 
"h2Wa"?</B><P><B>
</B>This is a break in consistency from how forms 1 through 7 
of "h2" were represented.  However, as "h" does not have forms 
after the sabI (the 7th form) there is no opportunity for confusion 
to arise from the omitted "2" of "h2W".  Hence "hW"<B> </B> 
will be uniquely identifiable as representing diqala forms of<B> 
</B>the h2 consonant. The advantage of dropping the "2" in the 
diqala range, will be the keystroke saved for typists.<P>
