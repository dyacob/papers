Selam EthioScience,

  If you are like me you probably have not seen any Ethiopic numbers in any vaule larger than
what would be used for writing years; and may be uncertain about the rules for writing numbers
greater than 10,000.  Also if you are like me, infact you would have to be almost exactly like
me, you were sketching out Arabic to Ethiopic number conversion algorithms during lunch today,
and actually enjoying it.  But if you were this much like me you would also be writing now
in which case one or both of us would cease to exist under The Cosmic Absurdity Theorem which
by requirement initiates the collapse of the known universe.  So I hope it is just me...


...If you do find numbers interesting then read on...


The purpose of this posting is to get feedback to see if I am totally wrong on the mechanics of
Ethiopic numbers as I have perceived them.  Converting an Ethiopic string of numbers into a
second system is trivial, convering from another system into Ethiopic I found requires a little
more care.


Notation:   A^B    ==>  B is the exponent of A
				A/B    ==>  integer division of A by B
				A*B    ==>  A multiplied by A
				A%B    ==>  A in the modulo class of B
				(A)    ==>  ``A'' is the Fidel equivalent
			 [A](B)   ==>  A instances of (B), Example: [3](B) = (B)(B)(B)



Lets take an arbitrary string of what we call Arabic numerals:

  EeDdCcBbAa

  The decimal exapansion is the same in both systems, but to rewrite the string in Ethiopian
numbers a delimitor of sorts appears:

  (E*10)(e) + 10^8 + (D*10)(d) + 10^6 (C*10)(c) + 10^4 + (B*10)(b) + 10^2 + (A*10)(a)

The delimitor that appears are the orders of 10 that must be inserted in the string as additional
Ethiopic numberals.  Observing that they are the exponents are all divisible by 2 we perform
a simple shift of this index:

  (E*10)(e) + 100^4 + (D*10)(d) + 100^3 (C*10)(c) + 100^2 + (B*10)(b) + 100^1 + (A*10)(a)


This form is more insightful as it becomes apparent soon that the orders-of-100 delimitors are
really sequences of the two Ethiopic numbers meto (100) and asr xi (10,000)   -lets also
abreviate (10,000) with (10K).

The exponents ``i'' of 100^i then tells us how many (100) numbers and how many (10K) numbers are
needed.  It is also quick to see that we only need the number (100) when i is odd.  We can take i-1
(or i alone when i is even) to tell us how many (10K) numberals to write. Our string is then:

  (E*10)(e)(10K)(10K)(D*10)(d)(100)(10K)(C*10)(c)(10K)(B*10)(b)(100)(A*10)(a)


The compacted formula for 100^i interpretation:

  100^i  = [i%2](100)[i/2](10K)


An example I can verify is for a year such as 1988 which becomes:

 1988  =  (1*10)(9) + 100^1 + (8*10)(8)  =  (10)(9)(100)(80)(8)


but this is a small number and again I truly don't know if dates are an acception or not.  I would
hope counting rules work independ of their application.
