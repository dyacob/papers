<h4>Note from the Editor</h4>

<p>* This is the first issue of &quot;Ethio Science &amp;
Technology&quot; for 1994.</p>

<p>* Today, the column comes with an important document written
by Yitna and Daniel about the work they done in the area of
representing the Ethiopian script with Latin and key entry
scheme. </p>

<p>* Their work is extremely invaluable and should not be taken
lightly. Those who are in Computer Science and in particular
typography will find it creative and educational.</p>

<p>* The editor believes that if the reader has any questions and
comments, may forward them to Cleo in order to allow the
participation of wide audience. Those who would like just to talk
the authors can contact Yitna and Daniel off-line.</p>

<p>* The editor would like to thank Yitna and Daniel for their
contribution to this column. Enjoy it!</p>

<p>Section 1/7</p>

<p><b>To The Reader:</b></p>

<p>The following is presented for your consideration as means of
representing Ethiopic script with Latin (or ASCII) letters. The
system presented has evolved extensively in the year that we have
used it for our personal correspondences through email. We
believe at this point the system is well developed but not in its
final form. Further refinements will only come after many have
had the chance to apply the system on their own. Any and all feed
back will be appreciated.</p>

<h3>Part I. INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p><b>A. Why does Ethiopic need ASCII?</b></p>

<p>The purpose of our proposal is to help in the creation of a
standard that will allow for the use of Ethiopic languages in
networked communications such as this one on Cleo. Even though
some attempts are made now and then to write in Amharic using
ASCII, the results (mostly salutations or short sayings) are not
always clear, consistent, or extended. We believe that a standard
might help encourage more online use of languages such as
Amharic, instead of being limited to English, even though the
text will be in ASCII form. In addition, two other areas of
development would be possible:</p>

<p>1) Word processor translation of e-mail: With such a standard
in place, word processors can be developed that can read e-mail
messages written using the ASCII/Ethiopic standard and translate
them into Ethiopic script. In reverse, the word processors can
translate text written in Ethiopic script into Ethiopic/ASCII for
uploading as an e-mail message.</p>

<p>2) Direct connection (e.g. X-windows): Developments in
creating Ethiopic fonts for client/server software could take
advantage of this standard and make direct synchronous
communication using Ethiopic script possible.</p>

<p>Software development in these areas have already been tried
out.</p>

<p><b>B. Considerations in Developing the Standard</b></p>

<p>We have taken the following two considerations in coming up
with our proposed standard:</p>

<p>1) The system must be easy to type on a 101 keyboard. This
entails:</p>

<p>-- finding the closest match between the Latin and Ethiopic
phonetic system (while being as </p>

<p>systematic as possible with the inevitable exceptions),</p>

<p>-- limiting the number of keystrokes necessary for each
Ethiopic character to a minimum, and </p>

<p>-- placing the most frequently used keys as close as possible
to</p>

<p>the &quot;home keys&quot; row of the 101 keyboard</p>

<p>2) The system must also be easy for machine translation. In
this case, the systematicity of the mapping of Ethiopic to ASCII
is exploited to make the machine translation between ASCII and
Ethiopic script (in word processors, for example) as fast as
possible.</p>

<p><b>C. Terminology:</b></p>

<p>1) <b>Alphabet vs Syllabary:</b> Though the concepts behind
these two forms of writing are rather simple, they carry a
history of controversy regarding which is &quot;better,&quot;
&quot;simpler,&quot; &quot;more useful,&quot; etc. [1] Without
getting into justifications for preferring one over the other, we
would only point out for our own purposes that
&quot;alphabet&quot; refers to the Latin or ASCII set in which
consonants and vowels are independently manipulated, and
&quot;syllabary&quot; refers to the Ethiopic script in which each
character is defined by a consonant + vowel combination. (We use
Latin and ASCII interchangeably.)</p>

<p>2) <b>Consonants and Vowels in the Ethiopic Syllabary: </b>The
Ethiopic syllabary contains 37 rows by 12 columns [2].
Thirty-five of the 37 rows contain a consonant (sometimes called
a &quot;radical&quot;) which is transformed in a fairly
consistent manner as it is combined with the 7 standard vowel
forms plus the 5 labialized (W) forms. This constitutes the 12
columns.</p>

<p>The only exceptions in this &quot;consonant + vowel&quot;
structure are row 18 (a) and row 22 (a2). In these two rows, the
Ethiopic syllabary contains &quot;independent&quot; or &quot;pure
vowels&quot; that can stand without a consonant. (This is
important to note because of the complications it creates when
Ethiopic interacts with the Latin alphabet.)</p>

<p>Section 4/7</p>

<h3>Part II. DEVELOPMENT OF THE SYSTEM</h3>

<p>It may first occur to one when attempting to write Ethiopic
script with Latin letters, to represent the 7 forms with numbers
as so:</p>

<p>Consonants:</p>

<p>h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 h6 h7</p>

<p>Independent Vowels:</p>

<p>a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 a6 a7</p>

<p>It is soon found in practice, however, that while this is a
very simple system for representing the Ethiopic characters, it
is not so simple to read or write in it (e.g.,
&quot;T5n1y6s6T6l6N6&quot;, &quot;a1d5s6 a1b1b4&quot;). This is
true largely because our minds are not trained to associate the
Latin script with Arabic numbers to form words. One will soon
wonder why not use the Latin vowel letters to denote the 7 forms
of the Ethiopic characters. This is where the trouble begins: How
do you represent the standard 7 Ethiopic forms (plus the
&quot;W&quot; forms) with only 5 Latin vowels? </p>

<p>The first step we took was to assign a punctuation mark (the
apostrophe ') and &quot;I&quot; for the two extra Ethiopic vowels
(plus &quot;W&quot; for forms 8-12). So, following phonetic guide
lines we came up with the following system:</p>

<p>Consonants:</p>

<p>h' hu hi ha he hI ho</p>

<p>Independent Vowels:</p>

<p>a' au ai aa ae aI ao</p>

<p>Again, after some trial use (e.g., &quot;Ten'yIsITIlINI&quot;,
&quot;a'disI a'b'ba&quot;) we found that the writing can be made
more readable if we used only one character for the pure vowel
form. Then the system reduces to:</p>

<p>Consonants:</p>

<p>l' lu li la le lI lo</p>

<p>Independent Vowels:</p>

<p>' u i a e I o</p>

<p>and our sample text would look like: &quot;TenayIsITIlINI',
&quot;'disI 'b'ba&quot; which becomes a little easier to read and
to type.</p>

<p>It is at this point that we began to notice two problems: </p>

<p>1) the 6th (or &quot;sadis&quot;) form of the Ethiopic
characters occurs more often than any other form (about twice as
often), and </p>

<p>2) the use of punctuation makes the &quot;look&quot; of some
familiar words peculiar.</p>

<p>The quick solution: </p>

<p>1) stop using &quot;I&quot; for the sadis (sixth form)
consonants, letting the consonants stand by themselves, and </p>

<p>2) switch the ASCII letters for the 1st and 4th forms of the
independent vowels.</p>

<p>Consonants:</p>

<p>l' lu li la le l lo</p>

<p>Independent Vowels:</p>

<p>a u i ' e I o</p>

<p>Examples: </p>

<p>Tena ysTlN</p>

<p>adis ab'ba</p>

<p>Ind'mn k'rmachWal</p>

<p>zare T'wat suq heje n'b'r</p>

<p>man'w smh? man'w smx?</p>

<p>Ambiguity Problem with The Independent Vowel</p>

<p>This system is easier to read and type, but there is still a
problem. If you have never before seen the word &quot;Tena&quot;
how will you know if you are reading 2 Ethiopic characters or 4
-- &quot;Te-na&quot; or &quot;T-e-n-a&quot;? This problem of
ambiguity usually occurs because it is not clear whether a
consonant letter is a sadis (6th) form followed by an independent
vowel form, or a syllable made up of the consonant and following
vowel form. Of course, this is a problem only if the reader does
not know the language. An Amharic speaker would not make such a
mistake. </p>

<p>In another scenario, the name &quot;Gabriel&quot; can be read
&quot;g'-b-r-el&quot; (correctly), or &quot;g'-b-re-l&quot; (not
quite correct, but okay when speaking fast). Though the ambiguity
is there, whether you interpret the Latin as showing 5
(g'-b-r-e-l) characters or 4 (g'-b-re-l) makes almost no
difference. </p>

<p>These conditions may not always be true, however, and the
difference does become a big problem for word processors and
computer software for translation. It is better then to insure
that the characters are unmistakably represented. To accomplish
this, our decision was to use capital (uppercase) letters for
independent vowels that appear after a sadis (sixth form)
consonant. Thus, we can rewrite Gabriel as &quot;gabrEl&quot; and
modify our system, which now includes a third category,
accordingly:</p>

<p>Consonants:</p>

<p>l' lu li la le l lo</p>

<p>Independent Vowels:</p>

<p>a u i ' e I o</p>

<p>Independent Vowels Following a 6th Form Consonant:</p>

<p>lA lU l|i l&quot; lE lI lO</p>

<p>We believe, however, that this third form will not be used
very much since most of the words in which a sadis precedes an
independent vowel allow (sometimes even require) a glide to occur
in which the sadis changes to whatever the independent vowel
dictates. Again, the concern here is for possible problems with
machine translation and not for ambiguity in the way people would
use the system.</p>

<p>(You will note that the pipe, &quot;|&quot;, symbol is used to
separate &quot;i&quot; after the sadis consonant. This is
necessary because we have already chosen the capital
&quot;I&quot; to represent the sadis vowel. We anticipate the
need to use &quot;|&quot; will be extremely uncommon. As a
footnote, however, the 2 character representation of the sadis
consonant can be &quot;l|&quot;. See Commonly Asked Questions #3
below.)</p>

<p>Section 5/7</p>

<h3>III. FINAL TOUCHES AND CONCLUSION</h3>

<p>This last system seen above developed through applied use over
the past year and has been successfully adapted to an
experimental version of a marketed Ethiopic word processor.
However, at the last minute, it was found that though easy to
write, reading the text remained visually challenging because of
the frequent occurrence of the punctuation mark used to represent
the first form consonants. We experimented with the system in
various ways to reduce the occurances of punctuation without
straying too far from the phonetic norms we had already
established and came up with five experimental alternatives.</p>

<p><b>System 1:</b></p>

<p>l' lu li la le l lo</p>

<p>a u i ' e I o</p>

<p>lA lU l|i l&quot; lE lI lO</p>

<p><b>System 2:</b></p>

<p>la lu li l' le l lo</p>

<p>a u i ' e I o</p>

<p>lA lU l|i l&quot; lE lI lO</p>

<p><b>System 3:</b></p>

<p>la lu li la' le l lo</p>

<p>a u i a' e I o</p>

<p>lA lU l|i lA' lE lI lO</p>

<p><b>System 4:</b></p>

<p>le lu li la l' l lo</p>

<p>a u i e ' I o</p>

<p>lA lU l|i lE l&quot; lI lO</p>

<p><b>System 5:</b></p>

<p>le lu li la l' l lo</p>

<p>a u i ' e I o</p>

<p>lA lU l|i l&quot; lE lI lO</p>

<p>Using the five systems we produced a few paragraphs of Amharic
text and asked readers at soc.culture.africa to vote on which
system they found most readable. (See Appendix A for the
questionnaire and sample text we sent out.) The system most
favored was number five which we now represent in this proposal:</p>

<p>Consonants:</p>

<p>le lu li la l' l lo</p>

<p>Independent Vowels:</p>

<p>a u i ' e I o</p>

<p>Independent Vowel Following a 6th Form Consonant:</p>

<p>lA lU l|i l&quot; lE lI lO</p>

<p>Our effort at representing the Ethiopic script with
Latin/ASCII has been a fairly straight forward matter. The reader
is now encouraged to review our proposal.</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<p>[1] Syllabaries in general do not distinguish between vowels
and consonants. They do not have a regularity, symmetry, or any
kind of matrix. The ancient Cypriot syllabary, the newly invented
(1821?) Cherokee syllabary, and even the modern Japanese Katakana
system have very little regularity. The syllables are arbitrary
marks that contain the consonant and vowel in one symbol that
does not allow any disassembly into constituent phonetic parts.
This aspect of syllabaries is sometimes used to show that they
are a less developed form of writing system. </p>

<p>Fidel, the Ethiopic syllabary, on the other hand, is highly
regular and has a quite clearly defined set of vowel markings
which were *added* to a base consonant/radical. In fact, just
looking at the Fidel one can see a clearly outlined alphabetic
underpinning. It seems that what we have in the Ethiopic system
is not a sort of pre-alphabetic syllabary, but an outright
further development of an alphabet--the Sabean alphabet which,
like Hebrew and Arabic had no vowel representation. It is more
plausible to see in Ethiopic a move from the Sabean alphabet back
into a syllabic form, but with a standardization based on
awareness of the explicit relationship between consonants and
vowels. To dismiss Ethiopic as an undeveloped writing system is
to overlook an example (perhaps the only one) of post-alphabetic
development in writing systems.</p>

<p>[2] The traditional matrix of the Ethiopic script is in rows
of seven columns with the base &quot;W&quot; form (here column
8), and the other &quot;W&quot; forms (here column 9-12)
presented separately at end of the list as extensions to the core
set. We felt a 37 x 12 matrix would be a more natural arrangement
both because of the similarity of the characters as well as the
efficiency it provides for machine access and manipulation of the
characters.</p>

<p>Some Commonly Asked Questions not addressed above:</p>

<p>1. Why not use uppercase vowels at all times?</p>

<p>This could be done. It would require that a different
character be chosen for either the 3rd or 6th form vowel to
maintain the single character representation. The primary reason
not to use capitals at all times for the vowels is that it
requires of the typist an extra keystroke (the &quot;shift&quot;
key). It is preferable to type with as little effort as possible.</p>

<p>2. What if I wish to show more sound for a sadis consonant?</p>

<p>It is not always accurate to say that the vowel component of
the sadis consonant is not spoken. For many words the vowel in
the 6th form consonant is clearly enounced. If you wish to write
in a more phonetic manner with out loss of clarity; this may be
accomplished by writing the 2 character representation form of
the sadis consonant when it is needed. As you will recall we have
redefined the 2 character form of the 6th consonant as
&quot;l|&quot;. We can mix the two character and one character
forms together in the same word to show when the vowel portion is
voiced:</p>

<p>ysTlN = y|sT|l|N</p>

<p>tgrNa = tg|r|Na</p>

<p>alf'lgm = alf'l|g|m</p>

<p>Tre = T|re</p>

<p>Writing with both the one and two character representations of
the 6th form consonant together may be more laborious to the
typist but has the advantage of giving the reader a better
demonstration of the word's sound when spoken. The mixed
representation is not ambiguous and does not pose any problem for
machine translation when going from Latin to Ethiopic. If it
would become a common practice to mix the two systems, we may
wish to try alternate characters in place of the pipe (
&quot;|&quot; ).</p>

<p>3. Why Are Numbers Used With Letters?</p>

<p>A problem that occurs when trying to represent Ethiopic script
phonetically in Latin is the presence of Ethiopic letters that
are phonetic equivalents. These cases are encountered with the
two Ethiopic characters for &quot;s&quot; and &quot;S&quot; and
the 4 characters for &quot;h&quot;. Representing one of the 2nd
forms with an unused Latin character, say F, R, or V, would be a
digression from phonetic norms and adds a level of complication
to the reading. In the case of what would be h4 the uppercase
&quot;H&quot; is chosen for representation. This choice models
the husky &quot;kh&quot; sound that the character has in Tigrinia
and other languages.</p>

<p>For the more common type of email exchanges omitting the
number 2 or 3 does not result in a loss of interpretation. The
use of the ordinals becomes more important later if the text is
to be read and translated into Ethiopic script by computer. </p>

<p>4. Why Does &quot;s2&quot; Come Before &quot;s&quot; ?</p>

<p>The &quot;2&quot; is only needed to distinguish the difference
between the two &quot;s&quot;s in Ethiopic script. In modern
writing it is the newer &quot;s&quot; (the 2nd &quot;s&quot;
appearing in the fidel) that finds the most frequent use in the
spelling of words. The first &quot;s&quot; is represented as
&quot;s2&quot; because it occurs less frequently in writing. Were
the 2nd &quot;s&quot; labeled as &quot;s2&quot; it would give the
typist more considerably finger more work to perform.</p>

<p>5. Why is The Capital &quot;W&quot; Used For Dikala Forms?</p>

<p>The uppercase &quot;W&quot; is used to remain phonetically
consistent with the sound of the dikala forms (forms 8 - 12). The
lower case &quot;w&quot; is reserved exclusively for consonant 21
with the &quot;w&quot; sound. Thus confusion and ambiguity is
avoided with use of the uppercase &quot;W&quot;.</p>

<p>6. Why is &quot;hWa&quot; used in place of &quot;h3Wa&quot;? </p>

<p>This is a break in consistency from how forms 1 through 7 of
&quot;h3&quot; were represented. However, as &quot;h&quot; and
&quot;h2&quot; do not have forms after the sabI (the 7th form)
there is no opportunity for confusion to arise from the omitted
&quot;3&quot; of &quot;h3W&quot;. Hence &quot;hW&quot; will be
uniquely identifiable as representing dikala forms of the h3
consonant. The advantage of dropping the &quot;3&quot; in the
dikala range, will be the keystroke saved for typists.</p>

<h4>APPENDIX A: Questionnaire and Sample Text</h4>

<p>Greetings to Ethiopic Script Readers,</p>

<p>Following you will find a sample Amharic text (an article
fragment from Ethiopian Examiner) written in 5 systems of
representation. It is not the purpose of this document to discuss
the development of the systems or to debate the merits and faults
of each. I solicit your opinion with respect to where you find
the most comfort and ease of reading. Please return to me a
ranking of the various systems in your order of preference (e.g.
3,5,1,4,2; 3 is best, 2 worst). Any additional comments are
welcomed. Please pass this letter on to your friends and
colleagues. Results of the survey will be posted when available.
A discussion of the latin representation system, along with an
ascii fidel, will be presented at that time. Note that the
difference between some systems is subtle, you may wish to print
this article to aid your evaluation. Your help is much
appreciated.</p>
