<H2>System for Ethiopic Representation in ASCII (SERA)</H2>
<PRE>

Dedicated to the work and memory of Abraham Demoz (1925 - 1994) 

In the time since the original publication of our paper
in "The Journal of EthioSciences" Volume 3 Number 1 on the
topic of representation of Fidel in 7-bit ASCII, the need
became apparent to extend the system to encompass
representation for Ethiopic numerals, punctuation, and mixed
script notations.  In the same period more was learned about
the treatment of certain characters outside of Amharic that
allowed for simplification of the ASCII representation.  The
following is a recapitulation of the original publication and
an assessment of some of the more recent developments.  A
complete discussion of many of these changes are available at
the Rensselar Polytechnic Institute ftp archive under the file
name SERA-94.

As we have indicated before, this system, though well
developed, is still not in its final form.  Further refinements
will only come after many have had the chance to use it and
test its strengths and weaknesses on their own.  As Abraham
Demoz, to whom we have dedicated this work, noted [1]: 

	"...script reform calls not only for a competent 
 	professional assessment of the technical aspects of 
	the script but also for a careful weighing of these 
	against the psychological and socio-political factors 
	that have a bearing on the written word and all that
	it stands for"

STUDIES. S. Segert and A.J.E. Bodrogligeti, Eds. 1983).

<A NAME="part1"><H3>1.  The System for Ethiopic Representation in ASCII (SERA) Table</H3></A>


Although some questions still remain to be answered regarding
the number of "forms" to use for the ASCII/ETHIOPIC table, we
have retained the original arrangement of twelve (12) for SERA
pending decisions relating to the Unicode/ISO standards
currently under discussion.  We do not believe a change in the
matrix of the table will affect the work discussed in this paper.

<A NAME="part2"><H3>2.  Considerations We Took in the Development of SERA</H3></A>


We have taken the following two considerations in coming up
with our proposed standard

      a)   The system must be easy to type on a 101 keyboard.  This entails:
 
           --   finding the closest match between the Latin and Ethiopic
                phonetic system (while being as systematic as possible with
                the inevitable exceptions),
 
           --   limiting the number of keystrokes necessary for each Ethiopic
                character to a minimum, and 
 
           --   placing the most frequently used keys as close as possible to
                the "home keys" row of the 101 keyboard
 
      b)   The system must also be easy for machine translation.  In this
           case, the systematicity of the mapping of Ethiopic to ASCII is
           exploited to make the machine translation between ASCII and 
           Ethiopic script (in word processors, for example) as fast as
           possible.




<A NAME="part3"><H3>3.  Development of the System</H3>
 

 It may first occur to one when attempting to write Ethiopic script
 with Latin letters, to represent the 7 forms with numbers as so:
 
      Consonants:
      h1   h2   h3   h4   h5   h6   h7
 
      Independent Vowels:
      a1   a2   a3   a4   a5   a6   a7
 
 It is soon found in practice, however, that while this is a very simple
 system for representing the Ethiopic characters, it is not so simple to read
 or write in it (e.g., "T5n1y6s6T6l6N6", "a1d5s6 a1b1b4").  This is true
 largely because our minds are not trained to associate the Latin script with
 Arabic numbers to form words.  One will soon wonder why not use the Latin
 vowel letters to denote the 7 forms of the Ethiopic characters.  This is
 where the trouble begins:  How do you represent the standard 7 Ethiopic forms
 (plus the "W" forms) with only 5 Latin vowels?   
 
 The first step we took was to assign a punctuation mark (the apostrophe ')
 and "I" for the two extra Ethiopic vowels (plus "W" for forms 8-12).  So, 
 following phonetic guide lines we came up with the following system:
 
      Consonants:
      h'   hu   hi   ha   he   hI   ho
 
      Independent Vowels:
      a'   au   ai   aa   ae   aI   ao
 
 Again, after some trial use (e.g., "Ten'yIsITIlINI", "a'disI a'b'ba") we
 found that the writing can be made more readable if we used only one
 character for the pure vowel form.  Then the system reduces to:
 
      Consonants:
      l'   lu   li   la   le   lI   lo
 
      Independent Vowels:
       '    u    i    a    e    I    o
 
 and our sample text would look like:  "TenayIsITIlINI", "'disI 'b'ba"
 which becomes a little easier to read and to type.
 
 After a short time a reader is likely to find that trying to "read a sound"
 from punctuation proves too difficult.  Our minds have been conditioned for
 too long already to skip over apostrophes when reading possesive and
 contracted words.  We introduce the principle now that whenever possible
 punctuation be avoided to represent spoken sounds and seek another alphabetic
 character to replace the apostrophe.  

 We find a suitable substitute in "E" but recognize right away the draw back
 of the extra "shift" required to type it.  With only a small intuitive feeling
 one will come to realize that the 5th form letters are used less often in
 writing than are 1st form.  Hence a swap between the two forms makes the use
 of "E" a little easier and gives us the new table :

      Consonants:
      le   lu   li   la   lE   lI   lo
 
      Independent Vowels:
       e    u    i    a    E    I    o

 and our sample text appears a little more naturally as:  
     "TEnayIsITIlINI", "edisI ebeba"


 It is at this point that we began to notice two problems:  
 
      1)   the 6th (or "sadis") form of the Ethiopic characters occurs more
           often than any other form (about a third more often), and 
 
      2)   the use of "e" for the first vowel makes the "look" of some familiar
           Amharic words peculiar, and the sound association is poor.
 
 The quick solution:  
 
      1)   stop using "I" for the sadis (sixth form) consonants, letting the
           consonants stand by themselves, and 
 
      2)   allow the use of "a" for the first form independent vowel with "e", 
           and introduce "A" for the 4th form independent vowel.
 
 
      Consonants:
      le   lu   li   la   lE   l    lo
 
      Independent Vowels:
       e\a  u    i    A    E    I    o
 
      Examples: 
            TEna ysTlN
            adis abeba
            Indemn kermachWal
            zarE Tewat suq hEjE neber
            manew smh? manew smx?
 
 
 Ambiguity Problem with The Independent Vowel
 
 This system is easier to read and type, but there is still a problem.  If
 you have never before seen the word "TEna" how will you know if you
 are reading 2 Ethiopic characters or 4 -- "TE-na" or "T-E-n-a"?  This problem
 of ambiguity usually occurs because it is not clear whether a consonant
 letter is a sadis (6th) form followed by an independent vowel form, or a
 syllable made up of the consonant and following vowel form.  Of course, this
 is a problem only if the reader does not know the language.  An Amharic
 speaker would not make such a mistake.  
 
 In another scenario, the name "Gabriel" can be read "ge-b-r-E-l" (correctly),
 or "ge-b-rE-l" (not quite correct, but okay when speaking fast).  Though the
 ambiguity is there, whether you interpret the Latin as showing 5 (ge-b-r-E-l)
 characters or 4 (ge-b-rE-l) makes almost no difference.  
 
 These conditions may not always be true, however, and the difference does
 become a big problem for word processors and computer software for
 translation.  It is better then to insure that the characters are
 unmistakably represented.  To accomplish this, our decision was to recycle
 the apostrophe ' as a separator for independent vowels that appear after a 
 sadis (sixth form) consonant.  Thus, we can rewrite Gabriel as "gabr'El" and
 modify our system, which now includes a third category, accordingly:
 
      Consonants:
      le   lu   li   la   lE   l    lo
 
      Independent Vowels:
       e\a  u    i    A    E    I    o
 
      Independent Vowels Following a 6th Form Consonant:
      l'a   l'u   l'i   l'A   l'E   l'I   l'o
      l'e   lU                            lO     <--also
 
 If we consider now an application for the remaining uppercase vowels; "U"
 and "O", we find that in some instances, as shown in the 2nd row of the 
 third category, the use of the apostrophe may be omitted without confusion.
 


<A NAME="part4"><H3>4.  Some Commonly Asked Questions </H3></A>

 
      1.   Why not use "sh" for "x" and "ie" or "y" for "E"?
 
           These would make logical choices for readers familiar with rules in 
           English but may not make sence in non-English speaking nations where
           a form of the Latin script is used.  It is desirable also to keep
           the keystrokes to a minimum for humans, the parsing requirements of
           computers as simple as possible, also media and transfer sizes to a
           minimum by avoiding multiple character representations when possible.
           
           Further, the reader is left to infer the meaning "sh" as one or two
           Fidel characters.  The separator ' presents a solution here but again
           complicates parsing and introduces special case rules vs generalized.
           The acception to the general rules also lends towards greater
           occurences of spelling errors.

           "ie" may be an easier keystroke than "E" but again introduces
           inference and parsing complexity.  The choice is not always logical
           as a phonetic model for the "ay" sound with Latin letters when
           considering such examples as "die", "vie", "pie", "lie", and "tie".

           "y" occurs more commonly in speech and written text as a consonant
           than as the 5th syllabic form.  Hence the lowercase Latin character
           is better reserved for the consonant to save on keystrokes.

           When an Ethiopic interface is available, these kinds of questions 
           become input method issues and not file IO and transfer which SERA 
           was primarily designed for.

 
      2.   What if I wish to show more sound for a sadis consonant?
 
           It is not always accurate to say that the vowel component of the
           sadis consonant is not spoken.  For many words the vowel in the 6th
           form consonant is clearly enounced.  If you wish to write in a more
           phonetic manner with out loss of clarity; this may be accomplished
           by writing the 2 character representation form of the sadis
           consonant when it is needed.  As you will recall we have redefined
           the 2 character form of the 6th consonant as "l|".  We can mix the
           two character and one character forms together in the same word to
           show when the vowel portion is voiced:
 
                ysTlN  =  y|sT|l|N
                tgrNa  =  tg|r|Na
                alfelgm  =  alfel|g|m
                TrE  =  T|rE
 
           Writing with both the one and two character representations of the
           6th form consonant together may be more laborious to the typist but
           has the advantage of giving the reader a better demonstration of
           the word's sound when spoken.   The mixed representation is not
           ambiguous and does not pose any problem for machine translation
           when going from Latin to Ethiopic.  If it would become a common
           practice to mix the two systems, we may wish to try alternate
           characters in place of the pipe ( "|" ).
 
      3.   I see the ' used in other ways, what are the complete rules? 
 
           The apostrophe was introduced as a separator to indicated that
           a vowel after a 6th form consonant does not modify the form of
           the consonant, ie "nE" is one Fidel letter and "n'E" is two. The
           principle of the separator may be applied elsewhere when it enhances 
           clarity.  For instance between vowels as in "beadis" vs "be'adis"
           or "keityoPya" vs "ke'ityoPya".  Here, the ' helps prevent the reader
           from slipping back into rules of English where the vowels would be
           combined into a single sound.  Also ' following a consonant as in 
           "t'" may be treated as another definition for the 6th form
           representation when convenient.
 
      4.   Why Are Numbers Used With Letters?
 
           A problem that occurs when trying to represent Ethiopic script
           phonetically in Latin is the presence of Ethiopic letters that are
           phonetic equivalents.  These cases are encountered with the two
           Ethiopic characters for "s" and "S" and the 4 characters for "h".
           Representing one of the 2nd forms with an unused Latin character,
           say F, R, or V, would be a digression from phonetic norms and adds
           a level of complication to the reading.  In the case of what would
           be h4 the uppercase "K" is chosen for representation.  This choice
           models the husky "kh" sound that the character has in Tigrignia and
           other languages.
 
           For the more common type of email exchanges omitting the number 2
           or 3 does not result in a loss of interpretation.  The use of the
           ordinals becomes more important later if the text is to be read and
           translated into Ethiopic script by computer.  
 
      5.   Why Does "s2" Come Before "s" ?
 
           The "2" is only needed to distinguish the difference between the
           two "s"s in Ethiopic script.  In modern writing it is the the 2nd "s"
           appearing in the fidel  that finds the most frequent use in the
           spelling of words.  The first "s" is represented as "s2" because it
           occurs less frequently in writing.  Were the 2nd "s" labeled as "s2"
           it would give the typist considerably more finger work to perform.
 
      6.   How was "e3" arrived at for the 8th vowel?

           The choice of "e3" is thought to be the best model for the sound of
           the character.  The sound of the character is in Amharic the same as
           that of "e" (the first vowel) in Tigrigna.  The choice of a numeral
           to follow "e" will detract from the reading quality of the character,
           which should come at a small cost when its infrequent use is
           considered.

      7.   Why is The Capital "W" Used For Diqala Forms?
 
           The uppercase "W" is used to remain phonetically consistent with 
           the sound of the diqala forms (forms 8 - 12).  The lower case "w" is 
           reserved exclusively for consonant 21 with the "w" sound.  Thus
           confusion and ambiguity is avoided with use of the uppercase "W".
 
      8.   Why is "Wu" Used For the Letter I learned was "W"?

           Actually both are valid under SERA.  In different geographic regions,
           and at different times within the same region, people have been
           taught two different sounds for the 2nd form labiovelar (which one
           may have learned as a 6th form).  Phonetic representations as "kWu"
           "kW" and "kW'", in example, are permitted for both ways a person may
           have been taught.  Each form is no more right or wrong than the
           other.

      9.   Why is "hWa" used in place of "`hWa" or "h2Wa"? 
 
           This is a break in consistency from how forms 1 through 7 of "h2"
           were represented.  However, as "h" does not have forms after
           the sab`I (the 7th form) there is no opportunity for confusion to
           arise from the omitted "2" of "h2W".  Hence "hW" will be uniquely
           identifiable as representing diqala forms of the h2 consonant.  The
           advantage of dropping the "2" in the diqalawoc range, will be the
           keystroke saved for typists.

     10.   What is done with the left-over Latin letters?

           The "left over" Latin uppercase consonants; B, F, J, L, M, R, V, and 
           Y, are now recognized as equivalent to their lowercase counterparts.
           That is "Y" in transliteration would be interpretted identically as
           "y" etc.  These same Latin characters are considered to be on a
           "reserve" status to model some overlooked sound in an Eritrean or
           Ethiopian language.
