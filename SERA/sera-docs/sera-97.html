<h3>Why SERA-97?</h3>

<p>What is being called ``SERA-97'' is the accumulation of adjustments that
occurred during the year 1996.  More so than not, changes in ``SERA-97'' are
simplifications.  The new SERA standard will be compatible with the bulk
of existing documents. This document describes adjustments and their
rationale, <a href="sera97-summary.html">a summary</a> is also available.</p>

<p>The necessity for change arose when the <a href="sera-95.html">SERA-95</a>
multilingual mechanisms were implemented in software and found to be overly
cumbersome.  Further SERA was too self imposing of its escape rules within
the domains of other scripts.  Simplification of SERA's multilingual and
punctuation escapes will make it a better citizen in multilingual
transliterated documents.  New escapes have also been added so that users 
default preferences can, optionally of course, be transported in a document.</p>

<p>The core of SERA remains the transliteration specification for Ethiopic
text. The adjustments to escapes are superfluous to the general user with
the average email software. The escape adjustment however assures developers
that they can apply SERA and maintain a documents integrity while still in
human readable form.  SERA-97 changes are now covered in the order of
importance to the Ethiopic composer writing in ASCII
(<cite>See the <a href="sera-faq.html">SERA FAQ</a> for the complete
specification</cite>).</p>


<h3>New Transliteration for <img src="fidels/e3.gif" alt="e3"></h3>

<p>The 8th vowel used in Amharic was represented in SERA as e3.  The sound of
the character of course is ``e''.  The rationale being that ``ea'' is a little
easier to read and easier on the eyes than ``e3'' -associating sounds with 
digits is unnatural.  ``ea'' is an unlikely construct in a word and should not
present conflicts with literal ``e''``a'' (i.e. 
<img src="fidels/e.gif"><img src="fidels/e.gif"> in Amharic or 
<img src="fidels/e.gif"><img src="fidels/A.gif"> in Tigrigna).  
If two and not one character is truly desired the SERA separator <b>'</b> may be
applied as per `` e<b>'</b>a ''.</p>


<h3>Transliteration for <img src="fidels/Ornament.gif" align="absmiddle"></h3>

<p>An icon used infrequently and primarily in advertisements and not literature,
is <img src="fidels/ornament.gif" align="bottom" alt="[Image]">.  The glyph may
be found in one font marketed by Monotype since 1989.  The icon is temporarily 
referred to as ``ornament'' (<em>if you know a <b>real</b> name please send 
<a href="mailto:Daniel_Yacob_at_UNECA@un.org">email</a></em>) corresponding
to its usage as decorative or ``ornamental''.  The SERA assignment is \~X  
which applies the private use escape system.  Otherwise, without using special
escapes the above is treated erroneously as a punctuation and not as a glyph.</p>


<h3>Ethiopic Numbers</h3>

Ethiopic numbers are now given by Arabic numbers, as before, but prefixed
with <b>`</b> rather than \ .  This change has been informally documented
in early 1996.  The rationale is to reserve \ strictly for escapes use with
the premise that all Ethiopic text should be represented in ASCII with out
the use of escapes.  This shift also formalizes the role of <b>`</b> as
an ``alternate'' modifier as it has played previously with phonically
equivalent syllables (i.e. se vs <b>`</b>se for <img src="fidels/se.gif"
alt="[Image]"> and <img src="fidels/s2e.gif" alt="[Image]">).


<h3>Default Setting Escapes</h3>

<p>SERA allows for adjustable transliteration for different writing practices
applied with Ethiopic text.  Such practices lead to different transliteration
preferences into Roman script.  Generally these preferences would be set as
application defaults and transcribed into and out of Ethiopic without loss
of content -given the same preference settings. To communicate these
preferences between applications and to assure the character integrity of the
document the default settings have thus far been defined:
<pre>
      \~`:    Use : for Ge'ez Wordspace `: (The Default if Unspecified)

      \~-:    Use : for Ge'ez Colon -:

      \~?     Use  ? for Ge'ez Stylized Question Mark  (The Default)
              Use `? for Ge'ez 3-Dot Question Mark     (The Default)

      \~`|    Use  ? for Ge'ez 3-Dot Question Mark
              Use `? for Ge'ez Stylized Question Mark
</pre>
Other preferences may be implicit to language selection.  In example the
transliterated value of ``a'' for Amharic 
(<img src="fidels/e.gif" alt="[Image]">) vs Tigrigna.
(<img src="fidels/A.gif" alt="[Image]">)</p> 


<h3>The Verbatim Mode Escape</h3>

<p>SERA has defined a special purpose ``Verbatim Mode'' whereby  all escapes are
ignored until the closing verbatim mode escape.  While little used, the verbatim
mode escape does offer a convenience to authors when called upon.  The verbatim
mode escape is now redefined in SERA-97 as \~! where previously it had been \! .
The rationale here is to avoid confusion with the punctuation escape rules and to
assert more strongly that \~ be required for special text processing.  The verbatim
mode in SERA is recognized now as special text processing.</p>

<h3>Multilingualism and Escapes</h3>

<p>During 1995 and 1996 changes have been creeping into SERA to make it 
more <em>language</em> and less <em>script</em> based.  This shift was 
necessary to meet the different needs of languages that use Ethiopic script
for writing.  Generally SERA documents are bilingual (English and Amharic for
example) but the foresight is also required for multilingualism (Arabic, 
Amharic, and Japanese, etc).  In practice however, simplification of the rules
initially introduced was found to be necessary.</p>

<p>There remains the inherent assumption that SERA documents will be bilingual
and the concept of a ``Primary'' and ``Secondary'' Languages are applied.
These are the languages traditionally toggled by \ in SERA.  They may now be
set explicitly by:

     <p><code>\~languagePrimary~languageSecondary</code></p>

     <p>which again sets the interpretation for an unadorned \ .
     <code>languagePrimary</code> and <code>languageSecondary</code> are ISO 639 
     <a href="http://www.stonehand.com/unicode/standard/iso639.html">two</a>
  or
     <a href="http://www.stonehand.com/unicode/standard/cd639-2.html">three</a>
     character language names (i.e. \~amh~eng for Amharic and English).</p>

    Example Usage:

    <pre>
    <code>\~amh~eng</code>   this is amharic        (Set Primary/Secondary)
    <code>\~tir</code>       this is tigrigna       (New Third Language)
    <code>\</code>           this is amharic        (Return To Primary)
    <code>\</code>           this is english        (Secondary)
    <code>\~ar~gz</code>     this is arabic         (Reset Primary/Secondary)
    <code>\</code>           this is ge'ez          (Secondary)
    </pre>


<h3>Undefined from SERA-95</h3>

<p>SERA-95 introduced a number of important ideas with ultimately poor
implementations.  As SERA documentation has indicated throughout 1996
the concept of a ``Mode for ASCII-Glyph Based Composition of Ethiopic
Punctuation'' is discarded.  Though the punctuations intruded in the
SERA-95 document are retained.  An exception would be the definition of
\? for the archaic 3-dot question mark which is now defined by `? (though
configurable as a writing practice preference).</p>


<h3>In The Future for SERA?</h3>

<p>We <em>hope</em> at this point changes in the basic transliteration system 
will not occur -but it is <em>impossible</em> to rule out future adjustments.
As more is learned about orthographic practices in Eritrea and Ethiopia; 
additions may be made albeit increasingly minor.</p>

<p>Ethiopic character have been found at the Academy of Ethiopian Languages 
that were devised for Sidamigna and related languages.  More needs to be 
learned about their sounds and actual use in print.  Possible SERA assignments
for this series of 28 characters might follow:

<table width="40%">
  <tr valign="middle"><td align="right"><font size=+3><b>Le or `le = </b></font><td><img src="fidels/l2e.gif" alt="[Image]"></tr>
  <tr valign="middle"><td align="right"><font size=+3><b>Me or `me = </b></font><td><img src="fidels/m2e.gif" alt="[Image]"></tr>
  <tr valign="middle"><td align="right"><font size=+3><b>Re or `re = </b></font><td><img src="fidels/r2e.gif" alt="[Image]"></tr>
  <tr valign="middle"><td align="right"><font size=+3><b>      `ne = </b></font><td><img src="fidels/n2e.gif" alt="[Image]"></tr>
</table>

</p>

<p>Another issue that needs to be addressed is handling of the often observed 
writing practice where ``go'' and ``ko'' are written when for the glyphs 
<img src="fidels/gWe.gif" alt="(gWe)"> and <img src="fidels/kWe.gif" alt="(kWe)">
instead of the more rigorously penned <img src="fidels/ko.gif" alt="(ko)"> and
<img src="fidels/go.gif" alt="(ko)">.  This writing practice is prevalent enough
for Ethiopic that it may be useful in SERA to set the glyph preferences with 
\~gWe and \~kWe or something similar.</p>
