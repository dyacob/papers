We will conclude this paper with samples of applied SERA.  Ethiopic text
in Latin form will appear unnatural and even unsettling to the native reader
reviewing SERA for the first time.  The reader is reminded that SERA is {\em not}
an effort to supplant Fidel with Latin script.  SERA grew out of the needs of 
Email users to communicate with Fidel across mediums that would not support it.
In the ultimate success of SERA, as a universal computer transport medium for 
Ethiopic writing, softwares alone are left to read and write the Latin script
 -providing the user with true Ethiopic. \\

As we have indicated before, this system, though well
developed, may still not be in its final form.  Further refinements
will only come after many have had the chance to use it and
test its strengths and weaknesses on their own.
