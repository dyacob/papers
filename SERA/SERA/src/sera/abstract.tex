\begin{abstract}
A convention for the transcription of Ethiopic script into the seven bit 
American Standard for Computer Information Interchange (ASCII) is presented.  
The convention provides a mechanism for computer interchange of Ethiopic text 
for single byte information systems.  The system of transcription is readily 
human readable and encompasses all elements of Ethiopic text which includes; 
letters, numbers, and punctuation.  The convention also provides a mechanism 
for the extension to multilingual text and may be employed for the keyboard 
entry of Ethiopic text elements.
